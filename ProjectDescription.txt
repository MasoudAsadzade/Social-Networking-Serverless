### General requirements

- The application must save all the messages in an additional storage for future analytics' purpose
- The application must be developed using the Serverless framework, Serverless Application Model(SAM) or equivalent
- Use whatever language you want. Use something that you know well.
- Provide a README with instructions on how to package, deploy and run the application.
- You must release your work with an OSI-approved open source license of your choice.

**IMPORTANT:**  Implement the requirements focusing on **writing the best code** you can produce.
